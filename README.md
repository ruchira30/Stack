# Stack
### The code is an implementation of a stack data structure in C. The stack has a fixed size of 10 and uses an array to store its elements. The program displays a menu with four options: push, pop, display, and exit. The push function is used to add elements to the top of the stack. It checks if the stack is full before adding an element. The pop function is used to remove elements from the top of the stack. It checks if the stack is empty before removing an element. The display function is used to print all the elements in the stack from top to bottom. The program runs in a loop until the user selects the exit option.
